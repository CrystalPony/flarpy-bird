# flARpy bird

This is a Flappy Bird game made with ARWeave in mind.

Press any button or mouse key to flap and fly up, avoid obstacles, sky, and the ground. Get score by passing obstacles and collecting Arweave coins.

## Original features:

* Collect Arweave coins for additional points
* Permanent Arweave-based leaderboard
* When you submit your score, your egg ("corpse") will start spawning in other players' games, and you can see where other players died in your game!
